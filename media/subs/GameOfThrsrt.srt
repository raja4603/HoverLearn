00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Father,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I wish to confess.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I wish to confess.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You wish to confess.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I saved you.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I saved this city

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and all your worthless lives.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I should have let Stannis kill you all.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Here I am.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
[Applause]

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Do you wish to confess?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes, father. I'm guilty.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Guilty? Is that what you want to hear?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You admit you poisoned the king. No, of

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
more monstrous crime. I'm guilty of

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
being a dwarf.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You are not on trial for being a dwarf.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, yes I am. I've been on trial for

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that my entire life.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Have you nothing to say in your defense?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Nothing but this.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I did not do it.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I had. Watching your vicious bastard die

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
gave me more relief than a thousand

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
lying

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I wish I was the monster you think I am.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I wish I had enough poison for the whole

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
pack of you. I would gladly give my life

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
to watch you all swallow it.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Samaran escort the prisoner back to his

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
cell.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will not give my life for Joffrey's

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
murder. And I know I'll get no justice

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
here. So, I will let the gods decide my

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
fate.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I demand a trial by combat.

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Heat.

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Heat.
