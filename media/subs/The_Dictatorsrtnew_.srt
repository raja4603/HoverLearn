1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
this contitution is nothing but a

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
license for oil companies and foreign

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
interest to destroy my beloved W wadia

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
will remain a

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
dictatorship W or be quiet why are you

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
guys so anti- dictators imagine if

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
America was a dictatorship

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
you could let 1% of the people have all

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the nation's wealth you could help your

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
rich friends get richer by cutting their

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
taxes and bailing them out when they

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Gamble and lose you could ignore the

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
needs of the poor for health care and

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
education your media would appear free

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but would secretly be controlled by one

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
person and his family you could wire to

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
phones you could torture foreign

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
prisoners you could have rigged

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
elections you could lie about why you go

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to war you could fill your prisons with

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
one particular racial group and no one

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
would complain you could use the media

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to scare the people into supporting

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
policies that are against their

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
interests I know this is hard for you

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Americans to imagine but please try I

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
will tell you what democracy is

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
democracy is the worst andless talking

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and listening to every stupid opinion

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and everybody's vote counts no matter

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
how crippled or black or female they are

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
