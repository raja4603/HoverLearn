1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I just wish Tommy was here.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:30,000
[Music]

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm telling you now, we got lost. I

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
can't really need to do a map. I mean,

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
[Music]

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
[Applause]

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
my boys are all here

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
[Applause]

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
today.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is my [ __ ] wedding day.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah. And you said there'd be no bloody

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
uniforms.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Neverless. Nevertheless, John, despite

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the bad blood, I'll have none of it on

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
my carpet. Now, for Grace's sake,

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
nothing will go wrong. Those bastards

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
out there and her family. And if you

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
[ __ ] do anything to embarrass her,

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
your kin, your cousins, your horses,

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
your [ __ ] kids, you do anything to

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
what?

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What about Sn?

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, they're women of sports. I'll say

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No. No, no,

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
no cocaine.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No cocaine, no sports, no selling

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
fortunes, no racing, no [ __ ] sucking

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
petrol out of their [ __ ] cars.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And you, Charlie, stop spinning your

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
arms about me, eh?

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, I'm just trying to sell you to them,

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Tom.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But the main thing is you bunch of

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
[ __ ] despite the provocation from the

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
cavalry. No fighting.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No fighting. No [ __ ] fighting. No

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
fighting.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No [ __ ] fighting.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Good.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Get the
